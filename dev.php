		<p>You can either send us a photo or I will come and photograph you child or children. This depends on type of position you would like.</p>

			<li>On all fours on a table (hands and feet)</li>
			<li>Standing on a table (feet)</li>
			<li>Waving from above (hand)</li>

		<h2>2. Do the drawing</h2>
		<p>I start the drawing process and create some magic. To make sure you are happy with what we deliver I keep you updated of progress by sending you photographs of the different stages in the drawing. This gives you an opportunity to give give us any feedback.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="one-third column">
		<h2>3. Add the prints</h2>
		<p>Finally, I take the prints once you are happy with the drawing. I do this to make sure that the prints are in the correct position based on the photograph. The prints can be a little tricky to do so we generally do a couple of tests so the children are comfortable with what we are doing.</p>
	</div>

        	<ol>
      		<li>Firstly take photographs of the little darlings partly because they move around so much and also because of the time needed to study them.</li>
      		<li>Then I take the prints based on the photographs and a lot of this is guess work as the positions aren't always easy to map to the photographs or they are different and we need to pull more than one photograph together to make a single drawing.</li>
      		<li>Finally we create the drawing around the prints filling in any gaps in the positioning.</li>
    	</ol>

    	<p>We have spent some time experimenting with the combination of adding prints to a regular life drawing.
