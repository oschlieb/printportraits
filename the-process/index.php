    	<h1>The process</h1>
	    <p>It has taken some time to get the drawings right. Scale, perspective and foreshortening of the children's positions has made it quiet difficult to capture with hand and footprints needing to be in very specific locations. I'm still experimenting and it seems to be working well!</p>

		<h3>1. Photographs</h3>
		<p>You can either send us a photo or I will come and photograph you child or children. This depends on type of position you would like.</p>
		<ul class="liststyle">
			<li>On all fours on a table (hands and feet)</li>
			<li>Standing on a table (feet)</li>
			<li>Waving from above (hand)</li>
			<li>Waving from the front (hand)</li>			
			<li>Sat down (feet)</li>			
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="one-third column">
		<h3>2. Do the drawing</h3>
		<p>I start the drawing process and create some magic. To make sure you are happy with what we deliver I keep you updated of progress by sending you photographs of the different stages in the drawing. This gives you an opportunity to give give us any feedback.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="one-third column">
		<h3>3. Add the prints</h3>
		<p>Finally, I take the prints once you are happy with the drawing. I do this to make sure that the prints are in the correct position based on the photograph. The prints can be a little tricky to do so we generally do a couple of tests so the children are comfortable with what we are doing.</p>
	</div>

	<!-- abroad -->
  	<div class="sixteen columns">
    	<h3>If we can't take the prints</h3>
    	<p>For those abroad or in places I can't reach I'm planning on creating some instructions in order to be able to take the prints yourselves. I will send you the drawing, roller, ink and instructions to do the prints yourself. Sounds scary? Don't worry you will have enough ink to do plenty of practice prints.</p>
