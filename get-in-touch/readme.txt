================ INSTALLATION ================

To install Restrict Content Pro - Math Verification, simply upload the unzipped folder called "rcp-math" to your wp-content/plugins directory.

Next, navigate to your WordPress plugins menu and click "Activate" on "Restrict Content Pro - Math Verification".

The math verification field will be automatically added to your registration form, and you will have a new option in the 
Restrict > Settings page that will let you modify the label displayed for the field.

When using math verification, you should NOT also use the reCaptcha included with Restrict Content Pro. This is meant to
be an easier to use replacement.
