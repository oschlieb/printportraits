    	<p>If you are looking for a unique and thoughtful gift or a memory of your children that won't fade we would like to offer you something special and timeless - a Print Portrait. We bring together pencil drawing portraits and prints in a single piece of artwork. We will come and take the actual prints of your child's hands or feet so you can have a latest and beautiful memory of your children.</p>
    	<p><strong>About our style</strong><br/>Our style is striking, strong with free-flowing forms focusing on the main feature of the picture - the face. We have been influenced by several important artist including Pablo Picasso, Cy Twombly and Alberto Giacometti. <a href="http://www.printportraits.com/about-me/">A little more about me</a>.</p>

  	<div class="one-third column">
    	<p><strong>We do regular portraits too</strong><br/>If you are just looking for a straight forward portrait of your family then of course we are more than happy to help. Just send us a picture of your children and we will create a wonderful pencil drawing.</p>
    	<p><strong>How do we make these drawings?</strong><br/>We have spent some time experimenting with the combination of adding prints to a regular life drawing. There are still a lot more different things we want to play with so this is only a starting point. <a href="http://www.printportraits.com/our-portfolio">Take a look at the process</a>.</p>
