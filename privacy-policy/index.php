<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p>
<p>The purpose of a website Privacy Policy is help webmasters and web-based businesses comply with data protection legislation. In the UK, that primarily means compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. Failure to comply with data protection legislation can lead to civil liability and criminal law penalties.</p>
<h2>(1) What information do we collect?</h2>
<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:</p>

<h2>(2) About cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie consists of a piece of text sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>
<p>We [may] use both session cookies and persistent cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit; and provide you with content based on your previous visits or your browser referral information.</p>
<p>Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google’s privacy policy is available at: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Our advertisers or payment services providers may also send you cookies.</strong><br>Our advertising services providers may send you cookies for the purpose of enabling the service of advertisements based on your previous visits to our website.</p>
<p>We may publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website. These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour on our website and on other websites across the web using the DART cookie. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google’s Ads Preference Manager, available at: <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a>. You can opt-out of the Adsense partner network cookie at: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/</a> or using the NAI’s (Network Advertising Initiative’s) multi-cookie opt-out mechanism at: <a hre="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>. However, these opt-out mechanisms use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser plug-in available at: <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites[, including this one.</p>
<h2>(3) Cookies in use on this website</h2>
<p>We comply to new EU Directive on privacy, the key provisions of this lawa are set out below with a list of the cookies used on this website.</p>
<p>In an amendment to Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC (the Privacy and Electronic Communication Directive, which the Regulations referred to above implement), Directive 2009/136/EC provides: "Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, inter alia, about the purposes of the processing. This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide the service."</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Acceptance Cookie - cc_cookie_accept</strong><br>Host cookie created to save your acceptance of cookies on this website. The expiration date for the cookie is set as 12 months into the future.</p>
<!--<p><strong>Application Session - PHPSESSID</strong><br>PHP sessions for WordPress it stores session information across pages but is deleted after a visitor leaves this website.</p>-->
<p><strong>X-Mapping - X-Mapping-kjicghkc</strong><br>The X-Mapping cookie is sent by the server to keep the user’s browser sessions intact as we load balance and use a clustered array of servers. If a user reloads a page they could be served the content from another server entirely but this cookie tracks the user to the same server.</p>
<p><strong>Visitor Sessions - __utmb &amp; __utmc</strong><br>The Google Analytics tracking for ga.js uses two cookies to establish a session. If either of these two cookies are absent, further activity by the user initiates the start of a new session.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Unique Visitors - __utma</strong><br>Each unique browser that visits a page on your site is provided with a unique ID via the __utma cookie. In this way, subsequent visits to your website via the same browser are recorded as belonging to the same (unique) visitor. Thus, if a person interacted with your website using both Firefox and Internet Explorer, the Analytics reports would track this activity under two unique visitors. Similarly if the same browser were used by two different visitors, but with a separate computer account for each, the activity would be recorded under two unique visitor IDs. On the other hand, if the browser happens to be used by two different people sharing the same computer account, one unique visitor ID is recorded, even though two unique individuals accessed the site.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Traffic Sources &amp; Navigation - __utmz</strong><br>When visitors reach your site via a search engine result, a direct link, or an ad that links to your page, Google Analytics stores the type of referral information in a cookie. The parameters in the cookie value string are parsed and sent in the GIF Request (in the utmcc variable). The expiration date for the cookie is set as 6 months into the future. This cookie gets updated with each subsequent page view to your site; thus it is used to determine visitor navigation within your site.</p>
